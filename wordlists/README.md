# Wordlists

Wordlists allow you to change the search phrases that will trigger a replacement as well as update the pool of words used during the replacement.

The extension comes pre-loaded with a default wordlist but that wordlist can be overridden with both official wordlists and community created versions.

The wordlists are listed below. As community lists are created, they will either be absorbed into the official list (see [contributing to the namelist](../CONTRIBUTE.md)) or added below.

| Wordlist | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [default](default.json)  | matches Donald Trump as well as the various organizations sharing the name |

## Installing a wordlist

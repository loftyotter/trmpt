# Contributing to trmpt

Thanks for looking to help out. This project is intended to grow with the support of anyone wanting to contribute.

Together we can.

## Suggesting a replacement name

Anyone wishing to contribute a new name item is encouraged to do so. We want this project to grow through the wide support of people across the planet.

Please open a pull request that includes **one** addition to add to any of the name lists. This is to support the project growing from the additions of many individual people over single contributors submitting many names.

The hope is that by limiting the name changes to one per person, the quality of the name additions will remain high.

### Name Code of Conduct

Please use common sense for name additions. This extension is intended to be made available on browser extension stores so for the time being we will try to stay within the decency rules of those platforms. This is open to change through community feedback.

So for the time being:

- nothing outright vulgar (i.e. fucker, shitface)
- additions should be alphabetized
- items submitted to the `given` list should be adjectives
- items submitted to the `middle` list should be nickname phrases not overly long
- items submitted to the `surname_adj` list should be adjectives
- items submitted to the `surname_noun` list should be nouns

# Bug Fixes

If you encounter an issue that you want to let the maintainer team know about, please create an `New issue` on the `Issues` tab.

If you are able to code the fix, please submit a pull request with the changes.

# Feature Requests

Any new features should be introduced using the issue tracker. This project is intended to stay very lean and unobtrusive to users. Any feature request that would add excessive bloat are discouraged.
